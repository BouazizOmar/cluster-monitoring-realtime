```

## Setup & Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js (v16+) and npm installed
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

To run the React frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To run the Express server:

```bash
npm run server
```

To run both simultaneously:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

### Production Mode

Build the frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the server (which will serve the built frontend):

```bash
npm run server
```

## Usage

1. The server connects to the Python chatbot backend located at `../chat-agent/`
2. Ask questions in natural language about your Snowflake data
3. The system will generate SQL, execute it, and visualize the results

## Notes

- The Express server acts as a bridge between the React frontend and the Python backend
- Ensure the Python environment has all required dependencies installed
- Make sure your Snowflake credentials are properly configured in the Python backend
