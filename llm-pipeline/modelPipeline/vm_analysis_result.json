Prompt:

You are a cloud operations specialist. You will be given a system monitoring report for multiple virtual machines. For each VM:

  1. Compare its metrics against healthy baselines.
  2. Identify any anomalies.
  3. Choose the single most appropriate action from:
     - NO_ACTION
     - RESTART_SERVICES
     - RESTART_VM
     - MIGRATE_VM
     - SCALE_UP
  4. Explain your reasoning in 1–2 sentences.

Report format:

---
VM Name: <string>
CPU Idle Time: <seconds>
Memory Used: <percent> of <total GB> (Available: <GB>)
Disk I/O Time: <seconds>
Failed Services (Count: <n>): [<service1>, <service2>, …]
Detected Anomalies: <anomaly_codes>
---

Your output must follow this template exactly:

---
VM Name: <name>  
Recommended Action: <one of the five options>  
Reason: <concise explanation>  
---

System Monitoring Report (2025‑04‑06 16:34:00 UTC):

VM Lubuntu:
  - CPU Idle: 986.9 seconds  
  - Memory used: 21.8% of 3.7GB (Available: 2.9GB)  
  - Disk I/O time: 50.6 seconds  
  - Failed services: ['NetworkManager.service', 'systemd-journald.service', 'systemd-logind.service'] (Count: 3)  

VM Lubuntu V2:
  - CPU Idle: 975.8 seconds  
  - Memory used: 21.5% of 3.7GB (Available: 2.9GB)  
  - Disk I/O time: 24.0 seconds  
  - Failed services: ['systemd-journald.service', 'systemd-logind.service', 'NetworkManager.service'] (Count: 3)  

VM Ubuntu:
  - CPU Idle: 917.9 seconds  
  - Memory used: 23.5% of 6.7GB (Available: 5.1GB)  
  - Disk I/O time: 38.5 seconds  
  - Failed services: ['NetworkManager.service', 'nginx.service', 'systemd-journald.service', '…'] (Count: 4)  

Now analyze and recommend.


Response:

---
VM Lubuntu:
 - Recommended Action: Investigate and restart the failed services.
 - Reason: The CPU idle time is high, and the same services are failing across both Lubuntu VMs, indicating a system-wide issue.
---

---
VM Lubuntu V2:
 - Recommended Action: Investigate and restart the failed services.
 - Reason: The CPU idle time is high, and the same services are failing across both Lubuntu VMs, indicating a system-wide issue.
---

---
VM Ubuntu:
 - Recommended Action: Investigate and restart the failed services.
 - Reason: The CPU idle time is high, and multiple services are failing, suggesting a system-wide issue.
